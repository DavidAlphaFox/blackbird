cl-async-future
===============
This is a standalone library for futures in Common Lisp that was originally part
of [cl-async](https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-async).

Documentation for cl-async-future lives on the [cl-async website](http://orthecreedence.github.com/cl-async/future).

This library will be duplicated in both [cl-async](https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-async)
and here until cl-async-future is added to Quicklisp.
